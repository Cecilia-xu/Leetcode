# K Sum Conclusion
- No.1 Two Sum : using hashmap (Notice: when two numbers are the same e.g. 2 + 2 = 4, do we have 2 different 2 in the array?)
- No.167 Two Sum II - Input Array is sorted : using two pointers
- No.170 Two Sum III - Data Structure design: combination of I and II
- No.653 Two Sum IV - Input is a BST: inorder is sorted array + two pointers
- No.1214 Two Sum BSTs: inorder- two sorted array + two pointers / two sets
