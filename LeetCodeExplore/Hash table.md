# Introduction
Hash Table is a data structure which organizes data using hash functions in order to support quick insertion and search. There are two 
different kinds of hash tables: hash set and hash map.
- hash set : one of the implementations of a set data structure to store no repeated values.
- hash map : one of the implementations of a map data structure to store (key, value) pairs.
