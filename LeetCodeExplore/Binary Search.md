# How to identify a binary search problem?
Binary Search is <strong> an algorithm that divides the search space in 2 after every comparison</strong>. Binary Search should be considered every time you need to <strong> search for an index or element in a collection.</strong> If the collection is unordered, we can always sort it first before applying Binary Search.
