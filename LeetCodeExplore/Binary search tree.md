# Introduction to BST
A binary search tree (BST), a special form of a binary tree, satisfies the binary search property:
- The value in each node must be greater than (or equal to) any values stored in its left subtree.
- The value in each node must be less than (or equal to) any values stored in its right subtree.<br>
*It is noteworthy that inorder traversal in BST will be in ascending order. Therefore, the inorder traversal is the most frequent used traversal method of a BST.*
