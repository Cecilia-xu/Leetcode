# Solution 1 : Two pointers
## Algorithm
Notice that the array is sorted and the starting index is 1 not 0
- Iterate the array from two ends to the middle
- Sum these two element
- If it is larger than the target, move the pointer at the end
- If it is smaller than the target, move the pointer at the start
- Stop iterating when sum is equal to target or start is not smaller than end 
## Pseudocode

## Complexity
- Time complexity: O(n)
- Space complexity: O(1)
## Solution 2: Binary search

## Solution 3: Brute-Force
